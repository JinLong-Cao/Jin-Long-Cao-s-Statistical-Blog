      <description>AbstractToronto is a highly populated location which means it’s crime rate will also be high. But will Toronto’s crime rate ever lower? In this paper we explore opendatatoronto’s dataset on “Neighbourhood Crime Rates”. We find that as Toronto’s population increase, the crime rate will increase with it.
IntroductionThere are 2,731,571 total people living in neighbourhoods around Toronto in 2019, with that total number increasing every year. We see that an increase in population will cause crime rate to increase as well, as a more populated neighbourhood would have a higher crime rate than a less populated neighbourhood.</description>
